Andrew-Square-WaitTime
======================

A simple (and very niche) <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> application that 
reads the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/">MBTA</a> Red Line prediction times for trains to arrive at Andrew Sq
going towards Alewife and renders a template for a mobile device with the time in minutes until the next T train.


Starting
--------
Using the Flask dev server, just run <code>python andrew-sq-redline.py</code>
